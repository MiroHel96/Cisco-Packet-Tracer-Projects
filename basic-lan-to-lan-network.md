In this project I create simple LAN network with the following setup: 

- 2 hosts (PC1 and PC2)
- 2 switches (Switch1 and Switch2)
- 2 routers (Router1 and Router2)

## Connections

PC1 to Swicht1 - F0/0 to F0/1
PC2 to Swicht2 - F0/0 to F0/1

Switch1 to Router1 - G0/1 to G0/0 
Switch2 to Router2 - G0/1 to G0/0 

Router1 to Router2 - G0/0 to G0/1
